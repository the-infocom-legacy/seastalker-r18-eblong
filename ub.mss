panel spread out before you. Buzz is in the copilot's seat just behind
you. A thick-paned wraparound view port, both fore and aft, provides
a wide angle of vision ahead and astern. TV
camera eyes and sonar transducers in the hull also enable you to monitor
your surroundings via video screen and sonarscope.
There is a sonarphone and a radio. There is also a hydrophone listening
device."
