@majorheading (EVENTS IN THE AQUADOME)

Events in the Aquadome fall into several sequences.
The program can step through several sequences concurrently.
For convenience, let's call
them by letters, and let's call the beginning of each sequence "turn zero."

Note: "he" never refers to Player, since Player's gender is unpredictable.
@heading (A. The air supply)
This sequence stops if and when Player fixes the air supply.
@begin (itemize)
0. Player debarks from the @I(Scimitar).

11. Player realizes that Zoe (or Tip, if Zoe is not visible) is having trouble
breathing.
(If Player asks Bly about the "private matter" before this turn,
then Antrim explodes angrily, and this sequence begins at this turn.)

17. First reminder appears on screen, giving 10-turn deadline.

23. Second reminder appears, giving 4-turn deadline, and Tip offers Player
Universal Tool if he hasn't before now.

27. At the last moment, Doc Horvak runs up and saves the day.

30. Zoe Bly asks Player for a private talk, and then again every 3 turns
until Player agrees.
@end (itemize)
@heading (P. Bly's private matter)
Zoe has perhaps already mentioned a "private matter" over the
sonarphone while Player was in the @I(Scimitar).
@begin (itemize)
0. Player enters Reception Area for first time.

15. If Player hasn't asked her about the private matter, she asks Player
directly, both now and every 3 turns after this. If Player assents or
asks her about it directly: if the air supply hasn't been fixed, then
Antrim explodes angrily, and sequence "A" begins at turn 11.

X. (The timing is unpredictable.)
Player enters Bly's office for the private discussion. She shows Player
the "black box" (see sequence "S").

X+6. Bly reminds Player that the Snark may return and asks if she may ask
Player some questions. If Player assents, she asks about
the @I(Scimitar) and lists Player's options for weapons; if not, this
"event" repeats after 3 turns.
@end (itemize)
@heading (S. Siegel's work on sonar)
This sequence begins when Bly shows Player the "black box." The next time
Player and Tip are alone, he says he has an idea for testing Marv.
(He also reminds Player, if necessary, to look in the black box.)
@begin (itemize)
0. Player asks Siegel directly to check the sonar.
Or Player asks Bly to give Siegel a job, and Player assents
to a job in the communications bldg.

4. Siegel reports back to Player about black box.

5. Tip asks to speak to Player privately: if Player refuses, Tip asks
again every 3 turns; if Player assents, Tip suggests testing Antrim
(see sequence "O").
@end (itemize)
@heading (O. Mick Antrim's work on overheating in sub)
@begin (itemize)
0. Player asks Antrim to check sub.
Even if Player doesn't ask him, Antrim goes off to
check it, 10 turns after the air supply is fixed
(sequence "A").

9. Antrim reports back to Player if the voltage regulator is still broken.

19. Antrim reports back to Player if Player already fixed the problem.

At end of Antrim's report, he suggests installing Emergency Survival Units.
If Player agrees, Greenup & Lowell report back 12 turns later.
@end (itemize)
@heading (G. Greenup's attempted escape)
Greenup starts to escape when Player tries to arrest him.
However, the timing doesn't begin until:
@begin (itemize)
0. Player looks at the video monitor in Bly's office.
Greenup's head is just coming into view.
If Player closes the airlock roof, the escape is foiled.

1. Greenup is climbing into the airlock.
If Player opens the airlock hatch, the escape is foiled.

2. Greenup is scrambling aboard the sub.
If Player cuts electricity, the escape is foiled.

3. If Player opened the airlock hatch and didn't close it, then
the Aquadome itself is flooded and the game's over.
@end (itemize)
