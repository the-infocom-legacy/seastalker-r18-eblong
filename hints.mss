Card #1, Hint #1. You'd better look inside that "[black box]".

Card #1, Hint #2. Tell him about the [overheating problem] we ran into with your new Bioceptor.

Card #1, Hint #3. "First, one of us puts this black box back on the sonar transducer. Then we'll send [Marv] to check on the sonar system -- and we'll see if he reports the black box!"

Card #2, Hint #1. Try finding [Horvak's diary]. It's in his locker in the dormitory. [never used]

Card #2, Hint #2. "Why not ask [Mick] to troubleshoot the @I(Scimitar) and see what he says?"

Card #2, Hint #3. While you're waiting, do you want to look at the [magazine] that Tip brought along?

Card #3, Hint #1. A [circuit breaker] has popped open on the Electrical Panel!

Card #3, Hint #2. The [Videoscope] has never conked out before! It @I(must) be due to sabotage!

Card #3, Hint #3. Why won't the reactor start? Is the [catalyst capsule] inserted in the reactor? Tip exclaims, "But you told Sharon to put the capsule in, so the @I(Scimitar) would be ready for another test run. I heard you tell her first thing this morning!"

Card #4, Hint #1. That [electrolyte relay] you screwed back in place is essential to the Air Supply System -- without it, the system would break down in a few minutes! That means someone must have removed it while you were docking in the airlock!

Card #4, Hint #2. If you can get behind [Thorpe's vehicle], you can shoot its controls, and then he'll be stuck!

Card #4, Hint #3. "We know what was causing it -- but [Mick] doesn't @I(know) that we know."

Card #5, Hint #1. You'd better check the [Emergency Survival Unit] under your seat.

Card #5, Hint #2. The gate isn't open yet -- and it won't respond to a remote-control signal without [electricity]!

Card #5, Hint #3. Hey! Don't forget your [Emergency Oxygen Gear]!

Card #6, Hint #1. "Don't bother going thru the sub tool kit," says [Tip]. "I've got one of your Universal Tools in my pocket. Here, use this -- it'll fit anything!"

Card #6, Hint #2. "The last time we saw the [Snark], it went off to the southeast. I suggest you look in that direction first."

Card #6, Hint #3. If you can shoot the [tranquilizer dart] at the Snark, then it would still be intact for scientific study. [never used]

Card #7, Hint #1. "What about a [49-er prospecting bazooka]? If that can drive a stake into bedrock, it can sure put a dent in that sea monster -- or maybe even in an enemy sub!"

Card #7, Hint #2. "Also, Doc Horvak @I(may) be able to concoct some sort of [tranquilizer] with which to sedate or stun the Snark -- although he fears the huge size of the creature may make this method unreliable."

Card #7, Hint #3. "We have a prospecting bazooka which could be fitted to the @I(Scimitar)'s [extensor claws]."

Card #8, Hint #1. The Aquadome needs help desperately! You must take a [submarine] there at once!

Card #8, Hint #2. Hadn't you better turn on the [Videophone] and answer that alarm call?!

Card #8, Hint #3. There's no response, because there's no [power].
