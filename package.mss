INVENTIONS UNLIMITED -
This vast scientific enterprise was originally founded by your father,
himself a world-famous inventor. You have since added even greater luster
to the family name with your own numerous and unique inventions.@*
The purpose of Inventions Unlimited is to advance the frontiers of human
knowledge in every field of science, and to increase our awareness of and
adjustment to the physical world on land, under the sea, in the air, and
beyond Earth's own life-supporting atmosphere into the remotest reaches of
Outer Space.@*
There are five main units of Inventions Unlimited -- namely, the original
research laboratory near the town of Frobton on the east coast of the
United States; the Psycho-Biological Laboratory in Arizona; the undersea
research station known as the Aquadome; the IU spaceport on a previously
uninhabited island in the Caribbean; and the IU Satellite Network, consisting
of an inhabited orbital space station and two communication satellites.
Together, these three satellites provide the IU Videocom Network with
global television and radio communication.

VIDEOSCOPE -
All the parts of Inventions Unlimited are connected in a Videoscope
network for communicating with voice and picture. In the center of your
lab is a Videoscope unit that works somewhat like a telephone. When it
rings, you should answer by turning it on. If the person is calling
urgently, a red alert signal will flash also. After you turn on the
Videoscope, you may need to tune it by turning the tuning knob.
