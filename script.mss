"Jim, snap out of it!" cries Tip Randall, bursting into your laboratory.
"The alert signal is on!"@*
As you look up from your top-secret plans for the SCIMITAR, a submarine
for capturing marine life on the ocean floor and still being tested,
you notice the alarm bell on the videophone ringing. Someone's trying
to reach you over the private videophone network of Inventions Unlimited!

(lab center)@*
You're at your workbench in the center of your laboratory, a small
part of the Lawrence Research Lab in the town of Frobton. The videophone
screen looms overhead, with its alarm bell ringing.@*
Tip is here.@*
A microphone is sitting on your workbench.

Okay, Jim, what do you want to do now?@*
> ANSWER PHONE@*
As the alarm bell stops ringing, a picture of a woman holding a microphone
appears, and you can hear her voice from the speaker. But both sound
and picture are fuzzy.@*
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)

What next?

> FIX IT@*
Ah, that's better! You recognize the woman as Commander Bly, who's
in charge of the Undersea Research Station of Inventions Unlimited,
called the Aquadome, just off the Atlantic coast. "Jim! Jim!" she's
saying. "This is the Aquadome calling the Lawrence Research Lab! We
have an urgent problem!"@*
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)

What next?

> TAKE MIKE@*
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)@*
You're now holding the microphone.

What next?

> TURN IT ON@*
Okay, the microphone is now on.

What next?

> HELLO@*
"Jim! Jim! Our transparent dome enclosing the Undersea Research Station
is being battered by a huge monster!"

What next?

> GOODBYE@*
"I hope to see you soon, Jim."

Something's wrong! The picture vanished from your videophone screen,
and the sound conked out!@*
Tip says, "That's strange! Maybe you should use the Computestor."@*
(Oh no! Your score just went down by 3 points!)

What next?

> DROP MIKE@*
Okay, the microphone is now on the floor.

What next?

> GO TO BREAKER@*
It's in the corridor.@*
(corridor)@*
You're in a corridor, with your laboratory to the west, a storage closet
to the south, and Kemp's office to the east. An Electrical Panel fills
most of the north wall.

Tip follows you into the corridor.@*
(If you want a clue, find Infocard #3 in your SEASTALKER package. Read
hidden clue #1 and put "Electrical Panel" in the blank space.)

What next?

> CLOSE IT@*
Okay, the circuit breaker is now closed.@*
(Your score just went up by 3 points!)

What next?

> GO TO CAPSULE@*
It's in the west walkway.@*
(west walkway)@*
You're at a work counter, next to the control gear used to operate
the test tank.
The test tank (which is now empty of sea water) is located in a large
work room, just south of your laboratory, with concrete-block walls
on three sides and a high metal roof. Most of its floor is dug out
and lined with steel, to form the huge tank used for developing and
testing underwater gear and the pilot models of your submarine craft.
There's a walkway around the tank on three sides -- north, west and
south. On the east side, a steel gate forms the wall of the room.

Tip follows you into the west walkway.@*
Sitting on the work counter is:@*
  a catalyst capsule

(Are you tired of seeing "What next?" Well, you won't see it any more.)


> TAKE IT@*
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)@*
You're now holding the catalyst capsule.


> GO TO REACTOR@*
It's in the SCIMITAR.@*
(SCIMITAR)@*
You're in the pilot's seat of the SCIMITAR, its operating control panel
before you.
A wraparound viewport, both fore and aft, provides a view ahead and
astern. You can also observe your surroundings with a sonarscope and
a hydrophone listening device. There's a sonarphone for communication.
You'll discover other features when you need them.@*
Tip is sitting behind you, reading a magazine.@*
The power reactor is off and open.@*
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)

Okay, the SCIMITAR is now facing toward the east. But it won't go that
way unless you open the throttle.


> CLOSE HATCH@*
Okay, the entry hatch is now closed.


> OPEN THROTTLE@*
The SCIMITAR glides smoothly out of the tank onto the surface of Frobton
Bay. You're heading east at 1 sea square per turn.@*
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)@*
(This might be a good time to use the command: SAVE.)


> D@*
The SCIMITAR noses downward, and sea water begins to wash over your
forward viewport. You're now diving at a speed of 5 meters per sea
square.@*
The sea water darkens to a deeper green as you descend from the sunlit
surface. Engine and propeller noises come over the hydrophone loudspeaker.@*
Suddenly a loud alarm bell begins to ring! The depth finder warning
light has begun to glow red.


> WAIT@*
(I assume you mean: wait 10 turns.)@*
Time passes...@*
The SCIMITAR quickly levels out at the desired depth of 5 meters. It's
still moving toward the east at a speed of 1 sea square per turn.@*
The depth finder warning light changes to orange, and the alarm bell
continues to sound.@*
The depth finder warning light fades to dark again, and the alarm bell
ceases.@*
The sonarscope shows an obstacle ahead! Unless you change course, you
will crash the SCIMITAR!
Tip says, "Hey, Jim, maybe you should look at the sonarscope."


> NE@*
Okay, the SCIMITAR is now moving toward the northeast.@*
The sonarscope warning light goes out.


> WAIT@*
(I assume you mean: wait 10 turns.)@*
Time passes...@*
Suddenly a loud alarm bell begins to ring! The depth finder warning
light has begun to glow orange.

The sonarscope warning light is flashing yellow! A ship is approaching!
Tip says, "Hey, Jim, maybe you should look at the sonarscope."@*
The yellow light on the sonarscope continues to glow.
Do you want to keep waiting? > NO@*


> LOOK AT SONAR@*
The yellow light on the sonarscope continues to glow.@*
Sonar shows the object reaching from the surface of the bay downward
to a depth of 10 meters. This must be the keel of a freighter entering
the harbor. It's moving toward the waterfront at the rate of 1 sea
square per turn.

Time passes...

(If you want a clue, find Infocard #2 in your SEASTALKER package. Read
hidden clue #3 and put "magazine" in the blank space.)
Do you want to keep waiting? > YES@*

The ocean has been getting darker as you dive toward the Aquadome,
turning from blue-green to dark green to a dull gray-green. It's becoming
duskier and murkier with every minute.

A yellow cone of light now illumines the water ahead. The SCIMITAR's
brass search light was automatically switched on by an electronic eye,
now that you're too deep for the sun to light the water.

Colorful sea life swims through the brass search light beam: a playful
dolphin, a school of herring... Oh, oh! Here comes a hammerhead shark.
And now a huge manta ray is gracefully gliding and flapping toward
you.

A crooning noise comes over the hydrophone loudspeaker, punctuated
by sighs and moans and a few weird whistles.

"There's a blip on the sonarscope at three o'clock!" yells Tip. "Aim
the brass search light to starboard, Jim!"
Do you want to keep waiting? > YES@*
The amazing Aquadome looms ahead. Its bright lights suffuse the sea
water around it with a glowing radiance.
The sonarphone is ringing.
Do you want to keep waiting? > YES@*

The SCIMITAR slows to a gentle stop, with engine idling and the joystick
pointing north. The autopilot has brought you to the docking tank on
the south side of the Aquadome. It also turned off the depth finder
for you.
At Commander Bly's order, the docking tank gate slides open, but you
could have done it by remote control, just as you did the test tank
gate.
The docking tank is filling up with tons of sea water.@*
The docking tank lies north. You can enter it by opening the throttle.
The bottom of the docking tank has an adjustable plastic cradle, which
adjusts to the keel of any submarine.


> OPEN THROTTLE@*
You feel the seat press against you, and the hydrojet gets louder.
You're now travelling at a speed of 1 sea square per turn.

The SCIMITAR is now resting in the cradle in the rectangular docking
tank. The docking tank gate closes, and so does the throttle.
Through the viewport you can see the water level going down inside
the docking tank. The docking crew is pumping out the sea water. This
will take 1 turn.
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)


> I@*
You're holding:@*
  a Universal Tool@*
  a Logbook

The docking tank is now clear of sea water and filled with air at sea-level
pressure. The engine shuts off.
The roof of the docking tank is sliding open, and the SCIMITAR is in
dry dock.
A ramp swings down from the top of the docking tank's north wall to
your entry hatch.


> OPEN IT@*
Okay, the entry hatch is now open.


> GO TO BLY@*
(If you want a clue, find Infocard #5 in your SEASTALKER package. Read
hidden clue #3 and put "Emergency Oxygen Gear" in the blank space.)

She's in the reception area.@*
(reception area)@*
You're now face-to-face with Zoe Bly and the Aquadome crew. They are
wearing badges which show the air quality in the Aquadome.

Tip follows you into the reception area.
The five Aquadome crew members are here.
Commander Bly is here.@*
Commander Bly says, "Welcome to the Aquadome, Jim! You're a sight for
sore eyes! We've been anxiously awaiting your arrival!"


> N@*
(dome center)@*
You're in the very center of the Aquadome, where the Air Supply System
rises like a tower, almost to the top of the dome itself.

Tip follows you into the dome center.


> OPEN DOOR WITH TOOL@*
Okay, the access door is now open.
You notice an empty space in the complicated assembly facing you. Something
has been unscrewed from this space!
Something is lying at the base of the cylinder, just inside the housing.
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)


> TAKE IT@*
You're now holding the electrolyte relay.


> SCREW IT IN@*
It fits!
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)


> GO TO STORAGE ROOM@*
(storage room)@*
The room is crowded with supplies and equipment. If you want to find
something, you'll have to search for it.

Tip follows you into the storage room.


> TAKE BAZOOKA@*
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)@*
You're now holding the bazooka.


> GO TO LAB@*
(Aquadome laboratory)@*
The Aquadome laboratory is equipped for all sorts of marine biochemical
research. The room is crowded with supplies and equipment. If you want
to find something, you'll have to search for it.

Tip follows you into the Aquadome laboratory.
Commander Bly comes too.
Doc Horvak comes too.

Doc Horvak says:
"Jim, right after the Snark ceased its attack, I detected a high concentration
of AH molecules in the sea water around the Aquadome. Have you ever
heard of such a phenomenon before?" > YES@*
Tip says, "Wait a minute! Wasn't there something about AH molecules
in that magazine? Shall I get it and see?" > NO@*


> DOC, FIX DART@*
This will take 5 turns.


> MOUNT BAZOOKA ON SUB@*
"Good idea! That should stop the Snark! It could disable an enemy sub,
too! Shall I do it?" > YES@*
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)@*
"Are you ready to take off now, Jim?" Zoe Bly asks anxiously. > NO@*


> GO TO STORAGE ROOM@*
(storage room)@*

Tip follows you into the storage room.


> CALL BILL@*
"Right here, Jim," he replies. "What would you like me to do?"


> BILL, INSTALL UNIT IN SUB@*
"Okay, we'll install it."@*
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)@*
Doc Horvak now comes rushing back, holding an aquatic dart gun. "Okay,
Jim, I've made a special 'trank' to use against an AH-type organism!
It's loaded in the dart gun. What shall I do with it?"
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)


> DOC, MOUNT IT ON CLAW@*
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)@*
Doc Horvak promptly mounts the dart gun on an extensor claw.@*
"Are you ready to take off now, Jim?" Zoe Bly asks anxiously. > NO@*


> GO TO TANK@*
(docking tank)@*
You're now in the docking tank, at the foot of the ramp.

Tip follows you into the docking tank.

Suddenly Commander Bly comes over and says, "Jim, can we discuss a
private matter now?" > NO@*


> WAIT FOR BILL@*
Time passes...

Suddenly Mick Antrim appears and says, "I'm going to check out your
new SCIMITAR, Jim!" Mick turns and climbs aboard the SCIMITAR.
Do you want to keep waiting? > YES@*

Suddenly Bill Greenup and Amy Lowell report back from the SCIMITAR.
"That Emergency Survival Unit is in place, Jim," says Amy. "Bill installed
the part under your pilot's seat, and I installed the rest."@*
Bill Greenup, for whom you're waiting, has arrived.


> IN@*
(SCIMITAR)@*
Tip is sitting behind you, checking the instruments.@*
The Emergency Survival Unit contains:@*
  a hypodermic syringe@*
There's a magazine here.

(If you want a clue, find Infocard #5 in your SEASTALKER package. Read
hidden clue #1 and put "Emergency Survival Unit" in the blank space.)


> TAKE SYRINGE@*
You're now holding the hypodermic syringe.


> GO TO DOC@*
He's in the storage room.@*
(storage room)

Tip follows you into the storage room.
Doc Horvak is here.


> DOC, CHECK SYRINGE@*
He heads for the Aquadome laboratory. It will take Doc Horvak 4 turns
to analyze the chemical contents of the hypodermic syringe.


> GO TO OFFICE@*
(Aquadome office)@*
The Aquadome office is small but tidy, with a single door leading out
and a good view of the ocean through the window.

Tip follows you into the Aquadome office and begins playing with the
station monitor.

Suddenly Commander Bly comes over and repeats, "Jim, can we discuss
a private matter now?" > NO@*


> WAIT FOR DOC@*
Time passes...

Doc Horvak's face is grim and pale as he reports the result of his
analysis.
"Jim, the hypodermic syringe contains a lot of arsenic, and some arsenic
is missing from my chemical supply shelf! If you'd been jabbed with
that hypodermic syringe, you'd be dead!"

Tip turns to you with a gasp. "Holy smoke, Jim! That's exactly what
would have happened once you warmed up the pilot's seat enough to trigger
the sensor relay!"@*
Doc Horvak, for whom you're waiting, has arrived.


> ARREST BILL@*
Greenup turns and runs away. Then a crew member reports seeing Greenup
running behind the dormitory. "He's going to try to escape in the SCIMITAR,
Jim!"
Commander Bly adds: "We can see him on the station monitor! The docking
tank control panel is here, too!"
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)


> LOOK AT MONITOR@*
The monitor screen shows Greenup's head just coming into view above
the top of the docking tank's west wall, as he climbs the outside ladder.
Once he reaches the top of this wall, he will come down the inside
ladder to the SCIMITAR.


> CLOSE ROOF@*
Closed.@*
Greenup can't get into the SCIMITAR and escape any more. Knowing he's
trapped, Bill Greenup gives up without a fight. Commander Bly orders
him handcuffed to a pipe in the galley.
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)


> OPEN ROOF@*
Opened.


> OUT@*
As you start to leave, you notice an oddly shaped metallic object lying
under Zoe's desk. It must be the special Fram Bolt Wrench!


> GO TO STORAGE ROOM@*
(storage room)

Tip follows you into the storage room.


> TIP, PUT FINE GRID IN SUB@*
"If the Snark stays near the sea floor, Jim, it may churn up silt.
Even with our brass search light on, we might have trouble aiming a
weapon. Wouldn't it be easier if we could spot its exact position by
sonar?" > YES@*
"Jim, our sonarscope shows each sea square as 500 meters across. A
blip indicates the APPROXIMATE position of an object. That's not good
enough to hit the broad side of a barn! Let me install a fine grid
on the sonarscope that'll show a blip's position to within 5 meters,
okay?" > YES@*
"Jim, I checked and found a fine grid that'll fit our sonarscope. I
can install it quickly! I'll have someone install a fine throttle control,
too, for tight maneuvering. It has the same 3 settings, but for small
sea squares -- 0, 5, 10, or 15 meters per turn."


> GO TO TANK@*
(docking tank)@*
Amy Lowell is here.


> AMY, LEAVE@*
"Okay."

Suddenly Mick appears and says, "I thought maybe you had a problem
on the way here, Jim, so I wanted to check on it. Everything seems
to be okay now."@*
Tip flashes you a meaningful glance. Mick Antrim's reaction may be
all you need to prove he's NOT the traitor. But you'll have to decide
for yourself.


> MICK, LEAVE@*
"Okay."


> CLOSE ROOF@*
Closed.@*
Tip says, "All set, Jim! The fine grid is installed on both the sonarscope
and the throttle -- and so are the dart gun and the bazooka! Let's
shove off and find the Snark!"


> IN@*
(SCIMITAR)@*
Tip is sitting behind you, checking the instruments.@*
There's a magazine here.@*
As you and Tip take your places in your seats, and close the hatch,
the docking tank roof is also sliding shut.


> FILL TANK@*
This will take 1 turn.


> I@*
You're holding:@*
  a Universal Tool@*
  a Logbook

The docking tank is now filled with sea water.
The adjustable cradle then releases the SCIMITAR's keel from its grip.


> OPEN GATE@*
Opened (by remote control).


> START ENGINE@*
Your revolutionary craft thrums with power, matching your own excited
heartbeat!


> S@*
Okay, the SCIMITAR is now facing toward the south. But it won't go
that way unless you open the throttle.


> SET THROTTLE FAST@*
The SCIMITAR glides smoothly out of the tank into the ocean. You're
heading south at 3 sea squares per turn.@*
(Your score just went up by 1 point!)@*
(This might be a good time to use the command: SAVE.)


> SE@*
Okay, the SCIMITAR is now moving toward the southeast.


> WAIT@*
(I assume you mean: wait 10 turns.)@*
Time passes...@*
"Holy halibut!" cries Tip. "There's a big cloud of silt ahead in the
brass search light. It's out of sonar range. This could be the Snark!
Want to hold course till we find out?" > YES@*
However you steer, the cloud holds steady. You may be on a collision
course with the behemoth that almost wrecked the Aquadome!@*
Your brass search light reveals TWO objects dead ahead!
One is the Snark. To the left of the tentacled creature -- YOUR left
-- you can make out a vehicle crawling along the ocean floor.
Tip says, "That's one of your Sea Cats!"@*
A voice crackles over the sonarphone: "This is Doctor Jerome Thorpe,
Jim! Do you read me?" > YES@*
Your answer brings a rasping laugh. "Of course you read me, or you
wouldn't be answering! Your lab assistant, Sharon Kemp, is seated behind
me. She'll enjoy what's about to happen as much as I will. Would you
like to hear what's in store for you?" > YES@*
"I'll blast your sub with a rocket! Then I'll guide my synthetic monster
to the Aquadome to destroy it! Can you guess what sealed your doom,
Jim?" > YES@*
"I'll tell you anyhow. I want to own the valuable ore deposit near
the Aquadome! Sharon and I consider it a wedding present from you and
your dad ..."@*
Thorpe breaks off with a sudden gulp, followed by some noise and then
a soft female voice:
"This is Sharon Kemp, Jim! Do you read me?" > YES@*
"Thank goodness! I conked Thorpe with a wrench! He fell onto the microphone,
and he's too heavy for me to move!"
(Your score just went up by 5 points!)

Suddenly the sonarphone gets louder.
Tip says, "That could mean Thorpe is awake and has moved away from
the microphone!"
You hear a sharp cry of pain from Sharon, then Thorpe yelling: "That'll
take care of you, my little double-crosser!"@*
Thorpe speaks into the microphone: "Now then, Jim Lawrence, I'm stopping
my Sea Cat so I can blow you into Kingdom Come as soon as you're in
my sights!"@*
(If you want a clue, find Infocard #4 in your SEASTALKER package. Read
hidden clue #2 and put "Sea Cat" in the blank space.)

Great! You and Tip can see the bazooka slam into the Sea Cat's power
pod!
"Hooray! That crippled the Sea Cat for keeps!" Tip cheers.@*
You hear a voice come over the sonarphone: "Jim, this is Sharon! Do
you read me?" > YES@*
"Something hit us, and Thorpe's out cold! He cracked his skull on the
bulkhead! I was waking up when I saw it all happen. I'll tie him up
so he can't cause any trouble.
The Sea Cat's regular engine is kaput, but he installed a backup engine
for emergencies. And the sonar control's still working. If you like,
I'll guide the monster to its cavern."

CONGRATULATIONS, JIM! YOU'VE COMPLETED YOUR MISSION!!
